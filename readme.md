# Fx Watchlist

For this last challenge in our learning TypeScript series, you'll need to create a watchlist for TV Series and Movies using Lightning and TypeScript. 


## Requirements

- The user should be able to add items to their watchlist by pressing enter on any item displayed on the homepage.
- The user should be able to navigate between both the home page and the watchlist page.
- The user should be able to see the items in their watchlist by navigating to the corresponding page.
- The user should be able to remove items from their watchlist by pressing enter on the items in the watchlist.

## Designs

Don't worry about strictly following the design. It's there to give you an idea of what the final product should look like.
